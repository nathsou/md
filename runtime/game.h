// Which game is running, and what the engine knows about it.
//
// Any game boots without a profile: its title ID comes from exefs/main.npdm and the recompiled code from its own
// exefs. A profile (games/<id>/: profile.h, game.c, patches.py) adds what one game needs on top of the engine: its
// versions' address tables, hook handlers for the instructions its patches.py marks, and fixes run at boot. Profiles
// register themselves with RT_GAME; the one whose version table has the main program's build ID is selected.
